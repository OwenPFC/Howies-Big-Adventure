This was developed in **one week** for the UBGD Summer Game Jam, with the theme of "temperature" Howie's Big Adventure is a first of its kind. A narrative driven, infinite runner, typing game.

This game is inspired by Nicholson Baker's amazing novel The Mezzanine. You play as Howie as he's taking his 1 hour paid lunch break, and as he walks, he ponders topics such as climate, muscle memory, bowling, and manhood. You must type out all of the words he's thinking while simultaneously maneuvering him left and right to stay in the shade of buildings to keep him from overheating on this hot summer day.

# Technical Notes

This game is a triumph for me. Almost exactly a year ago I was working on my first game, Typey Jose, which is also a typing game. The only difference is that Typey Jose's typing system is worse in every single way. I didn't even have true letter highlighting because HTML tags were too scary to me at the time. The system I made for Howie's is so good that I redid Typey Jose to incorporate the superior typing systemk

A lot was lost in implementation. I had these awesome thermometers for the bottom of the screen, but they did not work at all. There was going to be more incentive to walk on the right side of the screen by offering air conditioners over there occasionally, but that just never happened
